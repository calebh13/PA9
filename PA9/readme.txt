Game Instructions:
Use the mouse to move your player around. Press or hold spacebar to shoot.
The goal of the game is to shoot the centipede and survive for as many rounds as possible.
Shooting the centipede's body will knock a segment off, while shooting the head will reduce 
its health. 

IMPORTANT: Build Requirements
You must set the environment variable %SFML_DIR% to your SFML directory (the one with bin, lib, etc.)
To do so, open a command prompt as admin and run this command: `setx SFML_DIR <C:/.../sfml>`
Then simply git clone the repo and build the project using Visual Studio.
